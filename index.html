      <div class="about">

        <p> Yoshi is a Jardine Parrot, also known as a Red Fronted Parrot. Jardine Parrots originate from Ghana in Africa, and known for their affectionate nature and ability to mimic.
          <br></br>
          Yoshi was born on May 10th 2019, and adopted his pet Human, Victoria, in November 2019. Typically Jardines live between 30-50 years, so he is very much still a baby! He's a very friendly boy; he loves lots of attention and strokes. It's usually best to shower him with attention, or else he will scream and scream until he gets what he wants. He's very much a toddler - with wings!
          <br></br>
          Yoshi loves to have a shower with Victoria every morning; he has a perch in the shower, and loves to be splashed with water. After his shower, he likes to have a blow dry with the hairdrier. If he hears someone a shower, or blow drying their hair, and he's not invited, everyone knows about it!
          <br> </br>
          He also loves to hang out with Victoria whilst she's working, usually choosing to either sit on her shoulder (whilst constantly asking for strokes and cuddles), or he sits perched on her monitor. Sometimes, Yoshi likes to chew the corner of the monitor with his very large, very sharp beak. Victoria is now on monitor number 3.
